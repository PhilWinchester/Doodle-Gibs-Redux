Phil Winchester - Project 1 Proposal

Idea: Drag and Drop - Base Defense Game

Objective: Using jQuery-UI have a simple drag and drop base defense
game. The game will have two paths that enemies can walk down and
the user will have to place 2-3 defensive units along the path.

Challenges: Dynamically programming enemies and managing location,
movement, damage, etc. Class based units. Anchoring units after
placement. General game mechanics implementation limited by DOM and
using jQuery. Managing time and meeting daily goals.

10/4 - Draggable units in nav bar on bottom of window
10/5 - Enemy units following fixed path to base. On collision
  deal damage and destroy base.
10/6 - Defensive units attack and do damage to enemies.
10/7 - Adding resources and limit which units user can create
10/8 - Catch up and bug fix day...b/c those always pop up
10/9 - Additional features? more likely more bug fixes!!
10/10 - Finalize and submit by Midnight
10/11 - Present

Resources: Images already acquired from previous project.
  Found collision detection function on stackOverflow.
Styling:

DOM: Movement of units. Animation of units? on event change image

OOP: Classes for each unity with inheritance.
